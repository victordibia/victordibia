### Hi, I'm Victor

I am a Principal Research Software Engineer at Microsoft working on Generative AI and Agents. I have worked on a number of projects including [HandTrack.js](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js) (a library for real-time hand tracking in the browser using TensorFlow.js), [LIDA](https://github.com/microsoft/lida) (a library for automated data visualization using AI agents), and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) / AG2 (toolkits for building multi-agent applications).

**Projects:**

- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) — A programming framework for agentic AI
- [LIDA](https://github.com/microsoft/lida) — Automatic visualization generation with LLMs
- [Hand Tracking](https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking) — Real-time hand detection with neural networks

### Designing Multi-Agent Systems

AI agents like Claude Code, Copilot, and Devin are changing how we build software that solves complex problems — but designing reliable multi-agent systems requires more than chaining LLM calls together. [This book](https://buy.multiagentbook.com) draws on my experience building AutoGen to provide a first-principles guide across 15 chapters: it starts with foundations (what makes a task suitable for agents, a taxonomy of orchestration patterns from deterministic workflows to autonomous coordination, and UX principles for delegation design), then walks you through building a complete agent framework from scratch in Python ([picoagents](https://github.com/victordibia/designing-multiagent-systems/tree/main/picoagents)) — implementing the agent loop, tool systems, computer use agents, workflow graphs with checkpointing, autonomous orchestration, and integrating agents into web applications. The final sections cover what it takes to make these systems production-ready: evaluation using trajectories, optimization against common failure modes, distributed agent protocols (MCP, A2A), responsible AI considerations, and end-to-end applications including a software engineering agent.
